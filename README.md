# Motherbar-on-EURUSD
Inside Bar Trading Strategy: EUR/USD FX Pair
Project Overview
This project evaluates the profitability of a trading strategy based on inside bars in the EUR/USD forex pair. The analysis uses historical 5-minute candlestick data to identify and test the strategy under varying conditions. The objective is to determine whether the strategy is profitable and identify the optimal parameters for implementation.

Motivation
The inside bar trading strategy is widely used in technical analysis as a pattern for market consolidation and potential breakouts. I aim to validate this strategy based on my current trading style and explore whether it can be optimized for better profitability.

Data Source
